Description: Google's Compact Language Detector 3 is a neural network model for language 
    identification and the successor of 'cld2' (available from CRAN). The algorithm is still
    experimental and takes a novel approach to language detection with different properties
    and outcomes. It can be useful to combine this with the Bayesian classifier results 
    from 'cld2'. See <https://github.com/google/cld3#readme> for more information.
